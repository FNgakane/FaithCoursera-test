	<h1>hi Faiths, its a great day today
	</h1>
				<p>We would like to congratulate you on your upcoming birthday on ",/process_data/data/PremiumBirthday/DateOfBirth," and trust that it will be the start of an auspicious year for you.</p>
									<P>
									Your birthday is an important milestone in your financial and wealth journey and a good time to review whether the benefits you have in place still meet your needs. A vital issue to remember when you do review your financial plan is that an age-related premium increase for your PPS policy will take effect ",/process_data/data/PremiumBirthday/DateOfIncrease,". This increase occurs yearly based on age and is compulsory, as indicated in your policy documents. 
                                	</p>
									<p>	Please <b>double click</b> on the attachment and enter your <b>",/process_data/data/PremiumBirthday/DocPasswordSource,"</b> to see the details regarding this change.
									<p><b>Plan for the future with the help of PPS Investments</b></br>
When considering your financial and wealth journey, you should also consider the services PPS Investments has on offer. 
PPS Investments plays an important role in all our members with qualifying products’ financial journey – whether they have an investment product or not – as it manages the investment of funds in the PPS Profit-Share Account.
</p>
<p>Up until age 55, PPS Investments invest all the funds in the default Pooled PPS Profit-Share Account (High Equity) portfolio. From age 55, once a year, PPS Investments will give you the opportunity to choose in which of the seven investment portfolios it has on offer, you can invest your share of the PPS Profit-Share Account in. That is to ensure that this special nest-egg continues to grow – even during your retirement years.</p>
<p>As we at PPS believe success is better, shared – we have decided in 2022 to allow members whose PPS Profit-Share Accounts are vested with PPS Investments, to instruct us to pay their PPS Insurance, PPS Short-Term Insurance and their Profmed premiums using the funds in this account.
Now, following your birthday, it is the opportune time to discuss this option with your financial adviser.
